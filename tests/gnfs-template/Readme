  This is a template for a small gnfs factorization. Just put the
number you want to factor in the template.n file and run:

../factLat.pl template.n

(of course, you can and should change the filenames to something
more descriptive). If you're lucky and the factorization completes,
you can clean the directory with:

make squeaky

  This will delete all/most interediate files produced during the
factorization. Of course, doing this in the middle of a factorization
would be an extremely bad idea and you would have to completely restart.
So, by all means, don't do that.
