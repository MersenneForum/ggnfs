#include "filter.h"

/* produce <savefile_name>.d, a binary file containing the
   line numbers of relations in the savefile that are not 
   duplicates.

   This code has to touch all of the relations, and when the
   dataset is large avoiding excessive memory use is tricky.
   Cavallar's paper suggests dropping relations into a hashtable
   and ignoring relations that map to the same hash bin. This keeps
   memory use down but causes good relations to be thrown away.
   Another option is to put the (a,b) values of relations into the
   hashtable, so that hash collisions can be resolved rigorously.
   Unfortunately this means we have to budget 12 bytes for each
   unique relation, and there could be tens of millions of them.

   The implementation here is a compromise: we do duplicate removal
   in two passes. The first pass maps relations into a hashtable
   of bits, and we save (on disk) the list of hash bins where two 
   or more relations collide. The second pass refills the hashtable
   of bits with just these entries, then reads through the complete
   dataset again and saves the (a,b) values of any relation that
   maps to one of the filled-in hash bins. The memory use in the
   first pass is constant, and the memory use of the second pass
   is 12 bytes per duplicate relation. Assuming unique relations
   greatly outnumber duplicates, this solution finds all the duplicates
   with no false positives, and the memory use is low enough so
   that singleton filtering is a larger memory bottleneck 
   
   One useful optimization for really big problems would turn the
   first-pass hashtable into a Bloom filter using several hash
   functions. This would make it much more effective at avoiding
   false positives as the hashtable gets more congested */
