CJM, 2/18/05:
  These scripts were pilfered from elsewhere, and included here
along with the Readme file I found with them. They are to help
control the polynomial selection using the programs in the next 
higher directory.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Using this script:

You need a common file system for the hosts which should participate!
copy these 4 files in a directory.

Create a file 'name'.data containing a line "N 'number to factor'"
Edit the file .searchrc: change the projectname to 'name',
   adjust the parameters npr, normmax, normmax1, normmax2 and murphymax
   to the size of your number (see file parameters), and make sure the file
   search_a5 only contains the digit 0 (This file will be updated as the script runs).
You may also change search_a5step. This controls the size of the pieces
the processes get. Each task is logged in the file Start (and also in
Success). After a while you will see how long a host takes for a task
too complete. If this is too short or too long adjust search_a5step.

Starting the script:
Start "search-slave &" at each host (on multi-processor machines you
can start it multiple times).

Stopping the script:
Type "killall search-slave" at each host. It will finish the current
task. If you want to stop it immediately you also have to kill
pol51m0 or pol51opt at all hosts.

Results:
The polynomials found are in the files 'name'.'hostname'.'process-id'.cand.
You have to find the best Murphy_E value, e.g. by typing
cat *.cand | grep e-12 - | sort -k 10 | tail
(replace e-12 by e-11 etc for smaller numbers).
