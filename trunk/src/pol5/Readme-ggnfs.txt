  I sent T. Kleinjung an email asking for permission to
include this code in GGNFS and he was kind enough to allow
it. He informed me that it is under the GPL license, but
upon inspection, not all of the files had the GPL header. 
So I added the GPL headers for compliance. In the process, 
I took a few liberties - I was not entirely sure exactly who 
authored what, and so I made a reasonable guess and attributed 
code that otherwise had no indicator of origin to 
``T. Kleinjung and/or Jens Franke''. I also took the
liberty of assigning the copyright to T. Kleinjung, which
seems reasonable since he sent me the source code, though it
should perhaps be assigned to both as well? (I don't necessarily
want to bother either of them with such trivial details since
they likely won't care either way so long as they get the
credit for authoring).
  Finally, I took the liberty of listing those files as
``... part of pol5, distributed under the terms ...'' to
make it clear that these files are really part of a distinct
software package and have simply been assimilated into GGNFS.
(The tarball Kleinjung sent me was named pol5.tar.gz, so this
seemed as reasonable a choice as any).

  In any case, I hope I haven't taken too many liberties
here. And if there's anything really ugly in the code, it's
likely my brutal hack for inclusion in GGNFS, so don't blame
the original authors.
