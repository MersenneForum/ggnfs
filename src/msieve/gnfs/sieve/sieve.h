   factoring algorithm on each relation. We hope that the gcd
   splits a given relation into two approximately equal-size halves,
   so that each part is trivial (has one factor) or is easy (has two
   factors) to decompose; failing that, we hope that the gcd provides
   enough information to tell us whether going to the trouble of
   fully factoring the relation is unlikely to yield something useful.

   The algorithm depends critically on the fact that gcd(A,B) =
   gcd(A mod B, B), so that when B is massively smaller than A the
   former is easy to compute. We don't actually compute the gcd
   until each relation B has (A mod B) available, and it is the latter
